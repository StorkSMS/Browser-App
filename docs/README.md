# Stork SMS - Decentralized Messaging on Solana

Welcome to Stork SMS, a revolutionary decentralized messaging platform that combines the privacy and security of blockchain technology with the seamless user experience of modern messaging apps.

## What is Stork SMS?

Stork SMS is a decentralized messaging application built on the Solana blockchain that creates unique NFTs for every conversation. Unlike traditional messaging apps, Stork SMS ensures true ownership of your conversations through blockchain technology while maintaining the speed and usability you expect from modern messaging.
