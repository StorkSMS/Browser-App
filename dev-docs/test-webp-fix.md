# WebP Conversion Fix Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Server-side `node-canvas` library couldn't decode WebP images created by browser's Canvas API
- **Error**: "Unsupported image type" when validating client-converted WebP files
- **Solution**: Disabled client-side WebP conversion; server now handles all image processing

## Changes Made
1. Removed client-side WebP conversion in `uploadAndUpdateImageMessage` function
2. Updated file extension logic to use original file extension
3. Removed unused WebP conversion imports

## Testing Steps
1. Upload a PNG image (e.g., "Socials PFP.png")
   - Expected: File uploads successfully
   - Server converts PNG → WebP on the server side
   - No "Unsupported image type" error

2. Upload a JPEG image
   - Expected: File uploads successfully
   - Server converts JPEG → WebP (or falls back to JPEG if WebP fails)

3. Upload a GIF image
   - Expected: File uploads successfully
   - Server processes the GIF appropriately

## Server-Side Processing Flow
1. Client uploads original image format (PNG/JPEG/GIF)
2. Server validates the original format using `node-canvas`
3. Server converts to WebP if supported (with automatic fallback to JPEG)
4. Server creates thumbnail
5. Both images uploaded to R2 storage

## Benefits
- No more incompatibility between browser WebP and node-canvas
- Centralized image processing on server
- Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Reduced client-side processing load
